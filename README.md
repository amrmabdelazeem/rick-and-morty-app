# Rick and Morty NodeJS

Welcome to the Rick and Morty empire! This is a simple search application built using Node.js, EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates), TailwindCSS Axios and Rick and Morty API.
This project allows you to search with over 800+ indices of Rick and Morty characters, and search by name if it's the right name you'll get a random character from list of chars with the same name.


## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
* Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en).

1.Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/amrmabdelazeem/rick-and-morty-app.git
```
2. Change into the project directory:
```
cd blog-nodejs-ejs
```
4. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Usage
1. Start the application:
```
node index.js
```
OR
if you have nodemon installed:
```

```
